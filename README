Spaceship Escape

Description:
This program is a simple game written in Java, where the user will be able to
control a spaceship using the arrow keys, and stop the plane by pressing the
space bar. The end-goal of the game is to avoid the yellow star popping up from
the sides of the canvas as long as possible. The longer the user can survive
from the collisions, the higher place the user can get.

To run:
There is already a Makefile written to automate the compilation and running
commands. The user simply needs to navigate from the terminal to the folder
that contains the files and type

make run

to run the program.

To clean up the folder:
Upon running the program, there will be numerous class files created. Simply
type

make clean

to delete the class files.
